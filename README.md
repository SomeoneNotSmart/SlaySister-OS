## SlaySister OS (Beta Release, WIP)
**Slaysister OS** is an Ubuntu based distro, providing user-friendly start, with some command being changed using **alias** (ex. `sudo apt get update` --> `update`)

Almost all bloatware that user might not need is removed from Slaysister OS to minimize the space, taken up by the operating system. Slaysister OS is based on Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish), and has almost the same requirements

 - 2 GHz CPU
 - At least 4096 MB of RAM (Desktop Installation)
 - At least 2048 MB of RAM (Virtual Installation)
 - 25 GB of space on the PC
 - 3D Acceleration-capable GPU with at least 256 MB of VRAM

Here are the reviews of our dear testers ðŸ¥°
 1. "Please `sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /*` my system"  --- Server Administrator **[REDACTED]**
 2. "Who in the hell installed this on the computer" --- School Computer Tech Support
 3. "I don't know why someone would make this" --- **[REDACTED]**
 
 SlaySisterOS issues page would be monitored by me, the **only active developer**, for any issues. Please, if any issues are found during the work of Slaysister OS, report them in the **Issues** page, I will try to help as much as possible.
